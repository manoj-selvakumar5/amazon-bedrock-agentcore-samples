"""The validator's decision tools: the validator decides, and acts, through them.

The validator agent ends its review by calling exactly one of two tools:

  approve_expense   save the expense (Cedar still gates it at the Gateway)
  send_to_review    route it to a person, with the reviewer note written for them

The tools are **pinned**: they take the validator's confidence, notes and concerns, never
an amount or a field. The expense they save is the one the extractor produced, supplied
here by the orchestrator, exactly as the chat tools pin the verified user id. So the model
chooses, and cannot alter what is written.

The orchestrator keeps the guarantees it had when it executed the decision itself:
  - exactly one outcome: a second decision is refused, not acted on
  - fail safe: if the validator decides nothing, `fallback_review` routes to review
  - a Cedar denial of the save files a review instead

Because the validator calls the tools, Strands traces the decision as the validator's own
tool call. The Gateway calls inside keep their save_expense / human_review spans.

Pure orchestration: the Gateway calls and the note writer are injected, so this is
unit-testable with no AWS.
