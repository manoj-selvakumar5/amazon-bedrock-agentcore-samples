"""Stage 3: the code-based evaluators that carry the business metrics.

One Lambda backs several registered evaluators. `EvaluatorInput` carries `evaluator_name`,
so the handler branches on it and each metric is registered separately, returning its own
score. Deploying one function rather than one per metric.

    ReceiptsExtractionAccuracy  B2  did the extractor read the receipt right: dollars on the
                                    total, plus date, merchant, currency, subtotal, tax, tip
    ReceiptsRoutingOutcome      B4  was the escalation, or the auto-save, the right call

    ReceiptsThresholdControl    control monitor, not agent quality: did anything at or above
                                the Cedar limit save automatically

The first two judge model decisions: the extractor reading the receipt, the validator
choosing save or review. The third judges no model. It watches a deterministic control that
can still fail in production: a policy edited or detached, an engine in log-only mode, a
deploy without it. It needs no labels, so unlike the other two it can run on live traffic.
Straight-through rate is a count over B4's outcomes rather than an evaluator.

Each reads span attributes the agent stamps on the invocation span, never message content,
so all three keep working when prompt and completion capture is switched off.

Duplicates and splits are deliberately not here. That failure exists between receipts, so a
per-session evaluator cannot see it. It lives in the dataset scorer locally.

Test locally with no AWS:
